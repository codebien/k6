k6 v0.31.0 is here! :tada: It's a smaller release with some significant performance improvements, a new `http_req_failed` metric and changes to the output subsystem that enable output extensions with [xk6](https://github.com/k6io/xk6)!

## New features

### Output cleanup and registration API ([#1874](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1874))

The state of k6's output packages has been a development pain point for a long time which made it difficult to add new outputs in a consistent way. In the refactor done in v0.31.0 this has been mostly addressed and outputs now implement a saner `Output` interface.

In addition to this, an output registry was added to allow external outputs to be easily added. This expands the possibilities of what [xk6](https://github.com/k6io/xk6) can do, so now besides allowing external JS modules, it's also possible to build custom k6 binaries that use external output implementations! This is very useful if you use a system that's currently not supported by [the built-in outputs](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/results-output), or need some custom handling of the metrics k6 produces.

We are working on the proper documentation for this, as well as the overdue xk6 documentation about JS extensions, so keep a lookout on https://k6.io/docs/ .


### Marking requests as failed ([#1856](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1856))

It's now possible to declare expected HTTP response statuses for either the entire test or for individual HTTP requests, and k6 will emit a new `http_req_failed` metric as well as tag HTTP metrics with `expected_response: <bool>`.

For example:

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';

// Set expected statuses globally for all requests.
http.setResponseCallback(http.expectedStatuses({min: 200, max: 399}, 418));

export default function () {
  // This request will be marked as failed.
  http.get('https://httpbin.test.k6.io/status/400');
  // This request will be considered as "passed" because of the responseCallback override.
  http.get('https://httpbin.test.k6.io/status/400', { responseCallback: http.expectedStatuses(400) });
}
```

Running this script will produce a summary like:

```
http_req_duration..............: avg=204.57ms min=203.31ms med=204.57ms max=205.82ms p(90)=205.57ms p(95)=205.7ms
  { expected_response:true }...: avg=203.31ms min=203.31ms med=203.31ms max=203.31ms p(90)=203.31ms p(95)=203.31ms
http_req_failed................: 50.00% ✓ 1   ✗ 1
```

Note the new `http_req_duration` sub-metric for passed requests only and the `http_req_failed` Rate metric.

If the response callback is not specified, the default expected statuses will be `{min: 200, max: 399}`. The previous behavior of not emitting anything can be achieved by setting the callback to `null`, i.e. `http.setResponseCallback(null)`. Additionally the `expected_response` tag can be disabled by removing it from the default list of system tags, e.g. `k6 run --system-tags 'proto,subproto,status,method,url,name,group,check,error,error_code,tls_version,scenario,service'`.

The `http.setResponseCallback()` is meant to allow arbitrary JS functions to process responses, but for now only the `http.expectedStatuses()` callback is supported.


## Other enhancements and UX improvements

- JS: Because of the awesome improvements to [goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja), the JS runtime k6 uses, it's no longer necessary for k6 to load [core.js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) to polyfill missing JS features when using the default [`--compatibility-mode=extended`](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/javascript-compatibility-mode). So in v0.31.0 core.js has been dropped entirely, yielding some significant CPU and memory usage improvements. The actual numbers will depend on the use case, but for simple tests users can expect a memory drop of about 30-70% per VU, and a slight CPU decrease of about 5-10%. For more complex tests with a lot of JS code this benefit won't be as pronounced. ([#1824](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1824))
- JS: Also because of goja improvements, some Babel plugins were disabled which should decrease CPU and memory usage even more. ([#1822](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1822))
- JS: Expanded `ArrayBuffer` support in most internal modules, so now you can pass `ArrayBuffer` to `http.file()`, in `k6/encoding` and `k6/crypto` functions. This makes working with binary files more efficient as it doesn't require string translations. In upcoming versions we plan to expand this to the WebSocket module, as well as make some potentially breaking changes for APIs that currently return string (see the details in the Breaking Changes announcement below). ([#1800](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1800))
- The Docker image base was updated to Alpine 3.13. Thanks @andriisoldatenko! ([#1821](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1821))
- The Debian package now includes `ca-certificates` as a dependency. Thanks @Bablzz! ([#1854](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1854))


## Bugs fixed!

- JS: Babel is now also run on compilation errors, which improves support of some obscure language features. ([#1861](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1861))


## Internals

- JS: Some TC39 tests for unsupported features were disabled, improving the runtime of the test suite. ([#1816](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1816))
- CI: Some more tests were enabled on Windows. ([#1855](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1855))


## Breaking changes

- JS: While we don't expect the core.js removal and Babel changes to impact the vast majority of users, those were substantial changes in how k6 interprets JS and a minority of users might experience issues with their tests. Please report any unexpected JavaScript errors by creating a GitHub issue.

The following are not breaking changes in this release, but we'd like to announce them so users can prepare for upcoming releases.

- JS: The `ArrayBuffer` changes in this release are backwards compatible and shouldn't cause any issues, but in v0.32.0 some JS APIs that currently return string for binary data will return `ArrayBuffer` instead. This is the case for `open()` when used with the `'b'` argument, response bodies for requests that specify `responseType: 'binary'`, `crypto.randomBytes()`, `hasher.digest('binary')`, `Response.json()` and `Response.html()` when used with requests that specify `responseType: 'binary'`, and `encoding.b64decode()`. These changes shouldn't be a problem for most users that were simply using these values to pass them to other internal modules (e.g. opening a binary file and passing it to `http.post()`), but if the scripts modified the binary data or depended on the current array of integers they will need to be adapted to use [typed arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) instead. You can follow the discussion in [PR #1841](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1841) and [issue #1020](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1020).
- As part of the rebranding of Load Impact to k6, the k6 GitHub repository will be moved from https://github.com/loadimpact/k6 to https://github.com/k6io/k6 . Additionally because of Go's usage of URLs in package imports, the URL will be changed throughout the codebase. Since GitHub will maintain a redirect from the old location we don't expect this to impact a lot of users, or even external k6 contributors and xk6 developers, but be aware that the new URL should be used moving forward.
- Because of the [sunsetting of Bintray](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/), the DEB, RPM, MSI and Chocolatey package repositories currently hosted on Bintray will be moved to a self-hosted solution sometime in the upcoming weeks. We'll communicate these changes via our [blog](https://k6.io/blog/) as well as the [official documentation](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation).
